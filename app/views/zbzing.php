                  The TOU constitute  the entire agreement between you and Zingberry and govern your use of the  Service, superceding any prior agreements between you and Zingberry. The TOU  and the relationship between you and Zingberry shall be governed by the laws of  the State of New Jersey without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You  and Zingberry agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the  courts located within the county of New Brunswick, NJ. The failure of Zingberry  to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a  waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is found by a  court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree  that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected  in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and  effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any  claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the  TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose  or be forever barred. <br /><br />
                  19. VIOLATION OF  TERMS AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES<br />
                  Please report any  violations of the TOU, by flagging the posting(s) for review, or by emailing  to:  abuse@Zingberry.com Our failure to  act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act  with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.   You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to  quantify, it becomes necessary for Zingberry to pursue legal action to enforce  these Terms, you will be liable to pay Zingberry the following amounts as  liquidated damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of Zingberrys'  damages for the specified breaches of these Terms:  a. If you post a message that (1) impersonates  any person or entity; (2) falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation  with a person or entity; or (3) that includes personal or identifying  information about  another person without  that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay  Zingberry one thousand dollars ($1,000) for  each such message. This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes  lawful non-deceptive parody of public figures.   b. If Zingberry establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access  the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to  pay Zingberry one hundred dollars ($100) for each message posted in excess of  such limits or for each day on which you access Zingberry in excess of such  limits, whichever is higher.  c. If you  send unsolicited email advertisements to Zingberry email addresses or through  Zingberry computer systems, you agree to pay Zingberry twenty-five dollars  ($25) for each such email.  d. If you  post Content in violation of the TOU, other than as described above, you agree  to pay Zingberry one hundred dollars ($100) for each item of Content posted. In  its sole discretion, Zingberry may elect to issue a warning before assessing  damages.  e. If you are a Posting Agent  that uses the Service in violation of the TOU, in addition to any liquidated  damages under clause (d), you agree to pay Zingberry one hundred dollars ($100)  for each and every Item you post in violation of the TOU.  A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent  of the party engaging the Posting Agent to access the Service (the  &quot;Principal&quot;), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in  violation of the TOU) agrees to pay Zingberry an additional one hundred dollars  ($100) for each Item posted by the Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal in  violation of the TOU.  f. If you  aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any  purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of these Terms  without Zingberry's express written permission,   you agree to pay Zingberry three thousand dollars ($3,000) for each day  on which you engage in such conduct. Otherwise, you agree to pay Zingberry's  actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.  Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, Zingberry retains the right  to seek the remedy of specific performance of any term contained in these  Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such  term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any  combination thereof.<br /><br />
