        	<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Zingberry allows you to stay connected with your Rutgers University campus. Read and post status updates that are shared exclusively with other Rutgers students. Meet and search for new people who share similar interests with you from your classes, dorms, organizations and more. Video Chat request users you think are cool. Or just instant message them. All with Zingberry.</p>
<br />

<p><b>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS </b><br />
Zingberry provides a platform for Rutgers New Brunswick undergraduate students to upload their information in order to search & interact with one another (referred to hereafter as "the Service") subject to the following Terms of Use ("TOU"). By using the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using particular Zingberry services, you agree to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all Zingberry services, which may change from time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of the TOU, any guidelines, or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with Zingberry in any way, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of Zingberry. Zingberry has the right, but is not obligated, to strictly enforce the TOU through self-help, community moderation, active investigation, litigation and prosecution. 
<br />
<br />

<b>3. CONTENT </b><br />
You understand that all postings, account information, messages, text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, video chat conversations or other materials ("Content") posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item ("Item") of Content that you post or otherwise make available via the Service. You understand that Zingberry does not control, and is not responsible for Content made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Furthermore, the Zingberry site and Content available through the Service may contain links to other websites, which are completely independent of Zingberry. Zingberry makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or authenticity of the information contained in any such site. Your linking to any other websites is at your own risk. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, that you may not rely on said Content, and that under no circumstances will Zingberry be liable in any way for any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise made available via the Service. You acknowledge that Zingberry does not pre-screen or approve Content, but that Zingberry shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any Content that is available via the Service, for violating the letter or spirit of the TOU or for any other reason.
