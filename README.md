<b>What is Zingberry?</b>

A video chat based social networking site focused on helping college students network with other students who share similar interests.

<b>Workflow</b>

Users can search a term (such as a course, major, or interest). Results are displayed as a “Tile”: an image of a user consisting of a hover drop down menu that displays basic information, academics, organizations, interests, and a chat request option. When a tile is clicked, a user views that person’s “Dashboard.” This is where a user can see more details and photos of the user. When a user is on his own Dashboard, this page acts a landing page where he can edit his information as well as view who is online in the groups he is part of (such as classes, organizations, and dorms). If a user would like to get in contact with another person, he could send a chat request with a brief message. Zingberry gives its user the ability to view a user’s information before accepting a chat request. This ultimately gives power to the user on deciding whom to chat with. If a chat request is accepted, the two users will start an instant message conversation
